# Wrangling_WeRateDogs
This repository consists of datasets and Jupyter notebook developed in the wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) of 
the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent."  
 
 Using Python and its libraries, I have 
 - Gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats
 - Assessed its quality and tidiness
 - Cleaned the dataset
 
 I have documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
 I also have a report act_report.pdf that reports the data visualizations, findings and unique insights.
